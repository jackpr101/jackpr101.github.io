                    In addition to our core business in computational genomics, Jacent Labs maintains an active portfolio of equity investments, viewing stock holdings as a strategic asset class. 
                    These investments serve not only as a source of capital appreciation, but also as a foundation for long-term financial stability. We aim to generate returns that can be 
                    reinvested into expanding our software development, and continue expanding the company.<br><br>
                    <strong>Diversification is paramount.</strong> Equity is held within a personal <strong>Stocks ISA.</strong><br>
